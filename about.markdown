Hello everyone,

My name is Eduardo Correia, and I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of experience in both Front-end and Back-end development. Originally from Brazil, I currently reside in Portugal where I work as a software engineer.

My primary programming language is Javascript, and I've had extensive experience working with various frameworks, libraries, and tools in this area. However, I am also passionate about expanding my skillset and recently started learning Ruby on Rails.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creativity, collaboration, and innovation. As a software engineer, I'm constantly seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, and trying out new food spots around the city.

Thank you for taking the time to read my self-introduction, and I look forward to connecting with you all.
